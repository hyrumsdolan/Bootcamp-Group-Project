# PokeTherapy & Cocktail Generator ðŸŒŸ
 The Pokemon Therapist is a web application that integrates the power of ChatGPT, PokeApi, and Cocktail database Api to provide a Pokemon-themed therapy session. Users can also receive personalized cocktail recommendations creating a unique and enjoyable experience. We believe in honesty, and it's only fair to let you know that our Pokemon Therapist has a distinctive style that some might find...well, interesting. 
In summary, our Pokemon Therapist adds a sprinkle of Pokemon charm to the therapy experience and doubles as your go-to virtual bartender. If you're seeking a more traditional therapeutic approach, you might want to consult a human therapist. But if you're up for a unique and amusing experience, the Pokemon Therapist is here for you!
